<h1>Personal notes from this project</h1>

- I understood how to use npm and Webpack. </br>
- Also, this is the first time used export and importing modules in JS. </br>
- This is the first time I run some extra steps to deploy the webpage from a specific directory using additional git commands </br>
- One of the main takeaways for me is that learning how to be extremely organized can make the project much faster and smoother. </br>
- Additional note: I haven't spent much time focusing on styling.
